Backpropagation
Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used for training artificial neural networks. It uses gradient descent to minimize the error by adjusting the weights in the network.

Candidate Elimination
Candidate Elimination is an algorithm used in machine learning for learning a concept by iteratively refining a hypothesis space.

ID3 Algorithm
The ID3 algorithm is used to generate a decision tree from a dataset, which can then be used for classification tasks.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression.

K-Means Clustering
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data into a predefined number of clusters.

Locally Weighted Graph
Locally Weighted Graph is an instance-based learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It gives higher weight to nearby instances while making predictions.

Naïve Bayes
Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.
